# Java Calendar Application

## Description
This Java Calendar Application is a console-based utility that allows users to view, create, and manage events within a calendar. Built using Java 8, it leverages the `java.time` package to handle date and time efficiently. This project serves as a foundational step towards developing a GUI-based interactive calendar.

## Features
- **Day and Month Views**: Toggle between viewing a single day or an entire month, highlighting days with scheduled events.
- **Event Management**: Add, delete, and view one-time or recurring events.
- **Easy Navigation**: Move through days and months with simple command inputs.
- **Data Persistence**: Events are loaded from and saved to a text file, maintaining state between sessions.
